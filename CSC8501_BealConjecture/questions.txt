Write a C++ program to find the first five distinct, lowest BNTs that satisfy the Beal Conjecture. Your program should have a command-line interface for user interaction. Show and evaluate the equations that derive these BNTs.
Extend your program to find the first five distinct BNTs that are prime numbers.
Further extend your program to find BNTs where A, B, and C are within the range of 3 to 20, and x, y, and z are within the scope of 3 to 15. Show and evaluate the equations that derive these BNTs.
Develop your program further to write and read outputs to file. This will allow students to check each othersâ€™ solutions are correct regarding the preceding three questions.
Extend your program to find the first ten distinct BNTs that are composite numbers.
Extend your program to find the BNTs that are square numbers between 1000 and 100000.
Extend your program to generate an ASCII represented histogram of BNT occurrences between a minimum and a maximum value as specified by a user.
Find the highest BNT you can and display it with the equations that derive it. However, A, B, and C must all be greater than 2 for this task.
